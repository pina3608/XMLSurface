  [petr.kocicka@hyperqbs.org]

1.0rc1 -> 1.0rc2				September 14, 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fixes:
  Reverted to original save file serialization code instead of using
        Xerces XMLSerializer. Problems with extra spacing and hard 
	to read XML files should be gone.
  Fixed protected save method in GenericDOMEditPanel to allow 
	plugins to overide attribute values when a UI component
	exists with the same name as the attribute.
  Turned off more debugging statements. Hopefully we got them 
 	all out from the production mode.
  

1.0b3 -> 1.0rc1					September 1, 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Bug fixes:
  PCDATA attribute editor in generic edit panel didn't work on saved
        documents. Fixed visibility of MerlotDOMText nodes for this.
  Patched XML4j so it can find relative dtd's included in the main 
	or other dtd's.
  Removed or turned off lots of unneccessary debugging 

1.0b2 -> 1.0b3					August 24, 2000
--------------------------------------------------------------------
New features:
  Ability to specify the root element when creating a new document
	rather than xerlin using the filename of the dtd file.
  Better support for action plugins
	XSLT action plugin example included in distribution
  German localized UI and Error resource properties files
	submitted by Stefan Heller <sh@mendelson.de>

Bug fixes:
  More encoding types supported, including correct handling of
	windows Code Page 1252 (Cp1252) encoding when converting
	an existing document with no encoding into a properly 
	encoded XML document.
  Relative URIs for SYSTEM paths to dtds handled properly.
	Also relative URI's to other dtd documents handled.
  "Shadow" root node removed. This was really just the DOCTYPE 
	node showing up for some reason with certain plugins.
  Several bugs with Processing Instructions fixed.
  Removed FilenameFilter use for Windows FileDialogs
  

1.0b1 -> 1.0b2					June 27, 2000

  JavaDoc api documentation updated, and included with binary 
    distribution

Bug fixes:
  fixed some major bugs dealing with the Add-> menus based on the
    dtd content model
  uses DTDChooser when DTD files are missing instead of previous
    dtd file finder dialog.
  PluginClassLoader handles embedded jar files in the lib directory,
    handles getting resource streams better.


0.9a4 -> 1.0b1
--------------------------------------------------------------------
New features include:
  the new plugin architecture (thanks Tim)
  a DTD chooser list, and DTD cacheing
  Add->after and before menus.
