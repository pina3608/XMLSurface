/**
 * Interface to specify a ContentSpecification node.
 * <P>
 * This is used to describe the content 
 * specification of what a DTD element can contain.
 * <P> 
 * Example from a DTD: (el1?, el2+ (el3 | el4 | el5)*)
 * <P>
 * Each node is part of a tree and has a type. CONTENT_GROUP nodes
 * correspond to a ( ) delimted container, a CONTENT_SINGLE node
 * would be a single element leaf with no ordinality specified. (like 'el3' 
 * in the above example)
 * <P>
 * <PRE>
 * Possible types:
 * CONTENT_GROUP:    ( stuff between parens ) getLeft returns the first node
 *                                            getRight returns null
 * CONTENT_OR:       el3 | el4                getLeft returns the first leaf
 *                                            getRight returns a leaf or
 *                                              another non-leaf
 * CONTENT_CONCAT    el1?, el2+               getLeft, getRight acts the same
 *                                              as in CONTENT_OR
 *
 * Possible ordinalities:
 * CONTENT_SINGLE:   node with no ordinality  i.e. 'el3'
 * CONTENT_STAR:     node with zero to many   i.e. '(el3 | el4 | el5)*'
 * CONTENT_PLUS:     node with at least one   i.e. 'el2+'
 * CONTENT_ONEMAX:   node with at most one    i.e. 'el1?'
 * </PRE>
