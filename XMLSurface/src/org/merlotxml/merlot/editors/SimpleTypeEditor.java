 * event handling related to this component. Methods for event handling still
 * need to be added. For example, a BoundedNumberEditor sub-class might be
 * created that would only accept key strokes that would keep the value valid
 * betweens its defined bounds. Or, a DateTimeEditor that would allow the date
 * to be selected visually from a calendar.
