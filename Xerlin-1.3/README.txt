Welcome to the Xerlin XML editor version 1.3. 

Xerlin is an opensource XML modeling application 
written for the Java 2 platform (JDK1.2.2 or JDK1.3). 
Xerlin is being released by SpeedLegal Holdings, Inc.
as an opensource project. It is being written by a team
of engineers interested in seeing a nice user interface
for working with XML files.

This software is distributed under an Apache-style license.
Please read the LICENSE.txt file included with this software.

QUICK START
===========

You must install Sun's Java 2 Standard Edition to use Xerlin.
This is available from http://java.sun.com/j2se/  Xerlin
requires at least JDK 1.2.2 (or the JRE equivalent. JDK is 
the developers version, JRE is just the runtime environment)
JDK1.3 should also work.

You can start Xerlin on Windows by double-clicking on the 
Xerlin-1.3.jar file or on UNIX by running 
"java -jar Xerlin-1.3.jar" This will startup the main 
editor window. There are also shell and bat files provided
for starting up Xerlin.

To start a new file, click on the New File icon, or choose 
"New file" from the File menu. Xerlin will prompt you to
select a DTD. If you do not have any dtd plugins installed,
you will not see any available the first time. Click the
"Browse" button to find a DTD file. When you select a DTD 
installed on your filesystem, Xerlin will ask for a public
identifier. You can click "None" if you don't want a
PUBLICID added to your XML file. NOTE: Xerlin
doesn't handle all DTD files yet. 

Xerlin then asks for a root element name. You can type one in, or
select one from the list.

When you open an existing XML file which Xerlin cannot find 
the DTD for, it will prompt you to find the DTD. 
You can also browse for the DTD at this point. NOTE: Xerlin
caches information about DTD files, so the next time you 
open a file with the same SYSTEM identifier in the DOCTYPE
it will find the DTD you specified earlier. This cache is 
erased when Xerlin exits however.

For more detailed information, refer to the UsersGuide included in the
docs directory, or for the most up-to-date version, visit the documentation
section of the website.
